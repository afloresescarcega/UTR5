pseudocode for the 8x8 led display to flicker
the display can only do one row at once so we need to quickly flicker through the rows 
i hope this will be fast enough, if anyone has a better plan please write it in here, this is very experimental
use mapdata to get info about each spot grid location
ledmatrix.py has imlementation

loop for as long as you want to leave the led display on:
	loop y from 0 to gridsize:
		all rows and columns off
		turn on row y
		loop x from 0 to gridsize:
			color = off
			if (map_data.has_tunnel_for_loc(x, y)):
				color = appropriate color
			elif (etc):
				color = appropriate color
			...
			
			if (color != off):
				turn on col x with color
		short delay
